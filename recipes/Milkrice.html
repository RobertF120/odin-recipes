    <p>The coconut milk gave the pudding a layer of subtle sweetness, 
        and also inspired the fresh mango garnish, which really elevated these 
        bowls of comforting goodness.

    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>2¾ cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup Arborio rice</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>salt to taste </li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup finely diced mango</li>
        <li>1 pinch Chinese five-spice powder</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Direction</p> 
    <ol>
        <li>Beat 2 tablespoons milk with egg yolk in a small bowl. Set aside</li>
        <li>Combine 2 3/4 cups milk and coconut milk in a saucepan over medium heat. When mixture just begins to steam, reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in rice and cook for 1 minute. Pour in 1/2 cup coconut milk mixture; stir constantly until liquid is completely absorbed and rice is creamy. Repeat this process until the milk mixture is completely incorporated and the rice has a tender, yet slightly firm consistency, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir sugar and salt into the rice mixture. Remove from heat. Slowly whisk in egg yolk mixture until completely incorporated and the mixture is custard color, about 1 minute. Whisk in vanilla</li>
        <li>Cool pudding to room temperature, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until well-chilled, at least 3 hours. Garnish with mango and Chinese five-spice powder</li>
    </ol>
