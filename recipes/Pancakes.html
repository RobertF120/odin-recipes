    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup cold water or milk</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>

        <li>Whisk water and baking soda together in a mixing bowl. Add ricotta cheese, lemon zest, vegetables oil, sugar, egg, and vanilla. Whisk until smooth, breaking up lumps of cheese as you mix. Add melted butter, lemon juice, and 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons self-rising flour. Whisk together, stirring until most of flour disappears into the batter</li>
        <li>Let batter sit at room temperature about 15 minutes</li>
        <li>Heat lightly greased cast iron skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Portion out 1/4 cup scoops of batter onto skillet (cook in batches). When bubbles begin to form on the surface and the edges of the pancakes start to look dry (2 to 3 minutes), flip and cook other side until cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a warm plate</li>
    </ol>
